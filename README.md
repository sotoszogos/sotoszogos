<h1>Howdy, I'm Salvas</h1>
“I always stay on the details when I design something. I like taking challenges and I like working with others. 
My greatest strength is the ideation process of a product and the ability to draw 
something very quickly with my drawing skills. I’ve also have
knowledge in the design principles, aesthetic & emotional/affective design and design for all. 
I also have studied human - computer interaction and game design.”
